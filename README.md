# Nash_Vile_Housing Data Cleaning Using SQL
Enhancing Nashville Housing Data: This SQL project involves refining housing data from Nashville. 
The procedure standardizes SaleDate and populates Property Address data. It breaks down addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State). 
The project also focuses on splitting OwnerAddress into components (Address, City, State). Additionally, it handles SoldAsVacant values for consistency. 
To optimize data quality, duplicate rows are identified and removed. Unused columns like OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, 
and PropertyAddress are also dropped to streamline the dataset. This SQL endeavor aims to create a more organized and insightful housing dataset
